Introduction:


This script is designed to process and analyze product reviews using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, document retrieval, and sentiment analysis. It leverages the power of embeddings, language models, and vector stores to efficiently process large sets of review data, retrieve relevant information based on specific queries, generate context-aware responses, and classify sentiment to improve customer interactions.
The core functionality involves loading product reviews from a CSV file, storing them in a vector store for efficient similarity search, and then using a language model to generate responses based on these reviews. It also includes feedback classification (positive, negative, neutral) to generate appropriate responses, making it a versatile tool for various use cases in customer service, feedback analysis, and product review summarization.
Use Cases:
1.Customer Support Automation:
Scenario: A company receives a large volume of customer feedback in the form of reviews. Instead of manually reading through each review, the script can retrieve relevant documents, generate context-aware responses, and even classify the sentiment of the feedback. This helps support teams respond faster and more effectively.
Example: A customer asks for common issues with a product. The script can retrieve the most relevant bad reviews and generate a summary of the most frequent problems.
2.Sentiment Analysis for Product Feedback:
Scenario: Companies need to understand the overall sentiment of their product reviews to improve customer experience. This script can automatically classify feedback into positive, negative, neutral, or escalate categories, streamlining sentiment analysis.
Example: The script could classify customer feedback from a product review platform into sentiment categories and generate personalized responses based on the classification (e.g., thanking a customer for positive feedback or addressing issues in negative reviews).
3.Review Summarization for Insights:
Scenario: A business wants to quickly understand the general themes of a large number of reviews. The script can summarize customer feedback by retrieving the most relevant documents, combining them, and using a language model to provide a synthesized response.
Example: A retailer might use the script to extract and summarize key insights from reviews, such as the top-rated features or common complaints.

Product Improvement Analysis:
Scenario: Companies can use the feedback classified by the script to detect recurring issues or praise for a specific feature in their products. This can guide product development teams in making informed decisions for updates or improvements.
Example: The product team might want to know why customers gave low ratings. The script helps identify negative reviews and generates responses that directly address the issues, while also summarizing the reasons behind customer dissatisfaction.
Code Overview and Steps:
we are follwing the below steps to peform the above task 
This Python script seems to be focused on creating a system that:
Loads a set of reviews from a CSV file.
Creates a vector store to represent the data.
Retrieves relevant documents based on a query.
Generates a response to a query using a language model.
Classifies feedback and handles sentiment.
Integrates this all into a pipeline to generate and process feedback.



Output for the Code :
Generated Response from RAG :
Answer: Based on the provided documents, the review with the lowest rating (1.0 out of 5 stars) is titled 'It's bad' and was written by a reviewer named 'Amrit'.
 INFO - Feedback classification result:
INFO - In the review, the customer mentions that the product did not meet their expectations due to its design and functionality issues. The customer also suggests that the company should improve its quality control processes.
Assistant Output with Sentiments from review:
